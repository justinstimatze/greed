avoid self
avoid enemies

predict enemy path and steal ahead of them? surround enemy with your own?

vector based direction, always just outside range
shields targetPos from long term spying

coarse grained binning of regions on grid, heatmap.
blob detection? or will just avoiding self handle this?
